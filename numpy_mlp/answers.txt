1) We can't get better accuracies on the development set, only on the training set (leading to almost 100% accuracy on it).
This identification probably implies that the problem is lineary separable using bigrams features, and a more complex model will lead to overfitting.

2) With the log linear model and unigrams features we can achieve not more than ~70% accuracy on the dev set.
Using the MLP model were about the same accuracy with a little bit of overfitting.
Probably can achieve slightly better results with hyper parameters tunning including adapting learning rate, regularization, smart weight initialization etc.

3) Indeed we are able to learn the XOR function.
It take 5-15 epochs, depanding on the hidden layer size and learning rate.
When using gaussian initalization for weights, learning rate of 0.01 and a hidden layer of size 100, we can achieve 100% accuracy after 5 epochs.
